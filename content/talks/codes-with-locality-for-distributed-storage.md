abstract = """
In a distributed storage system, due to increase of storage capacity of a node, efficient repair of failed nodes is becoming increasingly important in addition to ensuring a given level of reliability and low storage overhead. Codes with locality are a class of codes designed for storage systems which have the characteristic that they trade off repair locality (number of nodes accessed to repair a failed node) for storage overhead. In this talk, we will survey the following results related to codes with locality:

1) Tradeoff between repair locality and storage overhead using a Singleton-like bound and a class of optimal codes known as Pyramid codes.

2) Pyramid codes provide repair locality for the message symbols. A Reed-Solomon code like construction has been proposed in the recent literature, which provides locality to all the codeword symbols and is optimal with respect to the Singleton-like bound. 

3) A variant of codes with locality known an maximally recoverable codes. These codes can recover from all failure patterns which are information theoretically recoverable given the repair locality constraints.
