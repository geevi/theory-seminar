Matroids are mathematical objects which abstract the concept of linear independence in vector spaces. The theory of matroids provides a variety of results which have impacted several important fields including graph theory, combinatorial optimization, information theory, coding theory, cryptography, etc. A decomposition theorem of regular matroids showed by Seymour is central to the story of matroids and its impact in some of the above fields. We shall hope to build a working  knowledge of matroid theory enough to understand Seymour's result (its proof being out of our scope), and see some of its utility in combinatorial optimization and coding theory. This will be a multi-part talk, with the first part introducing basic concepts, definitions, and results.
