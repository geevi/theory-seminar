We often need to count the number of distinct objects as in Combinatorics. But the objects has some symmetries which makes the problem non trivial. A simple example is that of a necklace with different colored beads. There is a rotational symmetry as well as one can flip the necklace. 

The P贸lya - Burnside enumeration is a theorem in combinatorics that solves the counting problem under symmetries. It models symmetries as a Group (as in Abstract Algebra) and analyses the action of the group of symmetries on the objects at hand. The theorem was first published by John Howard Redfield in 1927. In 1937 it was independently rediscovered by George P贸lya, who then greatly popularized the result by applying it to many counting problems, in particular to the enumeration of chemical compounds.

In this lecture, we will understand the P贸lya - Burnside Counting method and work out a a few examples. Some knowledge of the basic definitions of Group theory will be helpful for this lecture, which we will try to review quickly.
